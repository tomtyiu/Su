# Secure Encryption Example

This project demonstrates a secure encryption example using Java. It showcases the use of the AES-GCM encryption algorithm for securing sensitive data.

## Features

- Strong encryption using AES-GCM algorithm
- Secure key derivation with PBKDF2 and HMAC-SHA256
- Randomly generated salt and nonce for each encryption
- Protection against SQL injection and cross-site scripting
- Secure handling of exceptions

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- A Java IDE or command-line tool to compile and run the code

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or navigate to the project directory using the command line.

3. Modify the `main` method in the `EncryptionExample` class to customize the plaintext and passphrase to be encrypted.

4. Compile and run the `EncryptionExample` class. The encrypted ciphertext and the decrypted text will be displayed in the console.

## Security Considerations

1. **Passphrase:** Make sure to use a strong passphrase for encryption. Avoid using easily guessable or commonly used phrases.

2. **Key Management:** Ensure secure management of encryption keys. Avoid storing the keys together with the encrypted data.

3. **Nonce Generation:** The code generates a random nonce for each encryption operation. Nonces must be unique for each encryption to maintain security.

4. **Secure Input Handling:** Sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.

5. **Exception Handling:** The code includes secure exception handling, but additional error handling mechanisms may be necessary based on your specific application requirements.
